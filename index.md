# Vision & Learning for Autonomous AI LAB
The Vision & Learning for Autonomous AI *(VL2AI)* Lab at Monash is directed by <b>[Dr. Hamid Rezatofighi](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/hamid-rezatofighi)</b>
. Our research addresses the theoretical foundations and practical applications of computational vision. Our interest lies in discovering and proposing the fundamental principles, algorithms and implementations for solving high level visual recognition and reconstruction problems such as object and scene understanding as well as human behavior recognition in the complex 3D world.
